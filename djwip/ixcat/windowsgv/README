This directory contains some evaluations of plotting graphviz diagrams
using various python modules *other* than pygraphviz due to difficulty
in getting pygraphviz to work on 64bit python in windows.

Status:

The 'PyDot' and 'graphviz' modules were both tested and found to
be functional for plotting using a subprocess to render the graph.

PyDot is likely a better implementatino choice since NetworkX
has a native mechanism to interface with this library.

However, NetworkX v1.1 expects 'pydotplus' which is/was a pydot fork;
NetworkX v2.0 reverts  reverting to the original 'pydot' library -
therefore it might be best to migrate to NetworkX v2.0 before changing
any graph rendering backend and instead provide via some sort of patched
mechanism, or similar.

Background
==========

- Datajoint requires python >= 3.4
- Pygraphviz is currently used (2017-11) in datajoint for plotting
- Pygraphviz is a python module directly linked to the graphviz c-api 
- Graphviz does not have an official 64 bit windows relase
- MSVC is reportedly heavily 'version-specific' - e.g. builds are only
  binary compatible if built with the same toolchain.
- Only MSVC15 is readily available for Windows 10 at time of writing
- Unofficial/beta graphviz 64 bit builds are available using MSVC15
- PyGraphviz builds against python 3.4, 3.5, but graphviz builds are
  MSVC15 and py 3.4, 3.5 are not MSVC15 built.
- Python >=3.5 changes IO and requires non-merged patch to build pygraphviz
  on windows
- With patch, Build works but library load into interpreter fails 
  for some unknown reason.

So, theoretically a Python 3.6/graphviz build should be possible,
but for some reason the build doesn't "do". No extant reports show
a successful combination of 64bit, windows, py3.6, and we can't
build py<=3.6 without toolchain as a sanity check. Even then, patch
required by py3.6 is non-core yet, with no urgency in sight and 
requires unofficial graphviz and custom building, so investigaitons
were made into what else might work.
